This repository contains my efforts to predict the bike demand in Washington D.C. 
The datasets are used from the Kaggle competition on predicting the [Bike Sharing Demand](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand/)

The [Description of the Analysis](Analysis Bike Sharing Demand.md) gives an explanation on how I came to my predictions. in the first part I mainly used SPSS V20.0.0 since I used it a lot before for linear regression and descriptive analyses.
An [Excel file](first results.xlsx) contains the first results including the extra attributes I generated.
